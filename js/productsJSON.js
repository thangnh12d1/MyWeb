                "DETAILS": "The Impel is fast becoming a player favourite. It’s the ideal all-weather soft-touch training ball. It comes in three eye-catching colours and is equally at home on grass or astro. The precision-engineered 32 panel design delivers reliability with optimum shape and size control. The Impel is manufactured using a foam backed TPU for excellent soft touch in all weathers. It’s available in sizes 5, 4, 3 and 2, and the high retention bladder maintains ball shape and pressure for longer. That means you won’t have to waste time inflating it before every session. Important usage instructions: Your Mitre ball will be delivered ready to inflate. To avoid damage, make sure you follow these instructions. Care should be taken when inserting the inflation needle into the ball when using your Mitre pump, particularly on first inflation. Use Mitre glycerine to lubricate the inflation needle and allow it to be inserted smoothly and carefully. Once inserted, inflate your ball to the desired pressure. The recommended pressure is printed next to the valve. Never exceed the maximum pressure. The amount of pressure inside the ball will greatly affect its performance and lifespan, so it’s a good idea to purchase a Mitre pressure gauge to use alongside your pump. For match play, maximum recommended pressure should be used. For training, however, it is advisable to use the lower end of the pressure range. If your ball is wet or muddy, clean off any excess dirt with a damp cloth and allow it to dry naturally in a ventilated space, away from the cold. Never clean in a bath or shower and never dry with heat. You may damage your ball by doing so. Where possible, store your ball in a Mitre mesh ball sack until you next use it. Mitre is the world’s original sports brand. For over 200 years, we’ve been shouting our love and passion for the game. Even after all this time, we’re still the innovators, working hard to ensure Mitre products always deliver.",
